The UWA NLP-TLP Group is a team of researchers conducting state-of-the-art research in natural and technical language processing at The University of Western Australia in Perth, Western Australia. Our work is based in the following areas:

- Entity recognition
- Lexical normalisation
- Knowledge graphs
- Ontologies
- Annotation
- Adaptive user interfaces
- Knowledge representation and reasoning

We have a strong collaborative spirit and are well-connected globally. We have made a wide range of contributions to top-tier international conferences such as EMNLP, ICDM, and KR.

Our research group is unique in that we strive ensure our research is translated to practical software so that it can be directly used by industry. We have developed a number of software tools, including the Text2KG system which won the first prize at the 2019 ICDM Knowledge Graph Contest.
